                    PROJECT OVERVIEW — REXU (QRgency)
                    Scan. Connect. Save lives.
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
---------------------
This is a web app called "REXU" (the codebase name is Orchids QRgency). It is
built for one main idea: when someone has an accident or emergency (e.g. on a
bike or in a vehicle), a stranger or first responder can scan a QR code on the
person’s helmet or vehicle and instantly see their emergency contacts and
important medical information—so they can call family or ambulance quickly
without searching through the person’s phone or wallet.


WHO IS IT FOR?
--------------
- People who ride bikes or drive and want a simple way to share emergency info
  (contacts, blood group, allergies, medical conditions) without unlocking a
  phone.
- First responders or bystanders who find someone in need and want to help
  quickly by calling the right people and knowing critical health details.


MAIN FEATURES (WHAT THE APP DOES)
---------------------------------

1. LANDING / MARKETING WEBSITE
   - Homepage that explains the product: register, get a QR, stick it on vehicle
     or helmet, so in an emergency anyone can scan and see your details.
   - Sections: hero, how it works (register → generate QR → keep it on vehicle),
     pricing, and a clear call-to-action to sign up or log in.
   - Links in the footer: Privacy, Security, About, contact email, WhatsApp,
     Instagram.

2. USER REGISTRATION AND LOGIN
   - New users can create an account (email, password, full name, mobile).
   - Existing users log in with email and password.
   - Mobile number is verified using OTP (one-time password) so the account is
     tied to a real phone number.

3. USER DASHBOARD (AFTER LOGIN)
   - User sees their profile and can manage:
     - Emergency profile: blood group, guardian phone, secondary contact,
       emergency instruction note, age, language preference, organ donor status.
     - Medical info: allergies, medical conditions, medications.
     - Up to three emergency contacts (name, relation, phone).
   - User can add, edit, and remove contacts.
   - User can activate their unique QR code from the dashboard.

4. QR CODE ACTIVATION
   - Each user gets one unique QR code linked to their emergency profile.
   - Activation is “one-time lifetime”: pay once (or get it free if you’re in the
     first 1000 customers), then the QR is valid for life.
   - Pricing shown to users: first 1000 customers free, then ₹299 one-time.
   - After activation, the user can download the QR and put it on their vehicle
     or helmet. The QR does not contain any personal data—it only contains a
     secure token that opens the emergency page when scanned.

5. EMERGENCY SCAN PAGE (PUBLIC)
   - When someone scans the QR, they are taken to a public page that shows only
     the information needed to help in an emergency:
     - Name and age of the person.
     - Preferred language.
     - Blood group (clearly highlighted).
     - Severe allergies (in a prominent alert).
     - Medical conditions and medications.
     - A critical emergency instruction (e.g. “Call my wife first” or “I have
       epilepsy”).
     - Big buttons to call the guardian and secondary contact.
     - List of up to three emergency contacts with “tap to call.”
     - Quick buttons for emergency numbers (e.g. 112 for ambulance, police, fire).
   - The page does not collect any data from the person who scanned; it only
     shows what the vehicle owner set up. It is designed to load fast on mobile.

6. USER PROFILE PAGE
   - Logged-in users can open a profile page to update their name, mobile,
     avatar, date of birth, and similar account details.

7. STATIC PAGES
   - About: what REXU is, why it exists, how information can be updated.
   - Privacy: how user and emergency data are handled.
   - Security: how the product is built with security in mind.

8. ADMIN PANEL
   - Separate login at /admin for administrators (not regular users).
   - After login, admins see a dashboard with:
     - Total users, paid vs free activations, number of QR codes, and revenue.
     - Search users by mobile number.
     - List of recent users with their activation status (free or paid) and QR
       token.
     - Recent scan logs (when and from where a QR was scanned).
     - Ability to disable or re-enable a user’s QR code (e.g. if misused or
       requested by the user).

9. PAYMENTS
   - The app is set up to support one-time activation payment (first 1000 free,
     then paid). Payment integration (e.g. Razorpay) exists in the code; the
     README notes that payments can be mocked for development (e.g. first 1000
     free, then a mock payment is recorded).

10. MOBILE OTP
    - Phone numbers are verified by sending an OTP. In development, OTP can be
      mocked (e.g. code shown in server logs); later it can be connected to a
      real SMS provider without changing the main app flow.


IN SHORT
--------
- Users sign up, verify mobile, fill emergency and medical info, add contacts,
  and activate a QR code (free for first 1000, then one-time fee).
- They put the QR on their vehicle or helmet.
- In an emergency, anyone can scan the QR and see a simple page with contacts,
  blood group, allergies, and instructions—and call with one tap.
- Admins can monitor users, activations, scans, and revenue, and can turn off a
  user’s QR if needed.

The project is a complete product from landing page to user dashboard to
emergency page and admin tools, focused on “instant emergency contacts via QR”
for real-world safety.
